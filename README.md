# Introduction

Welcome to **Pinehood's Automatic Alternative Artificial Influencer (@alter_art_influ)**

Node.js and TypeScript application that runs a cron job, which **creates an Photo Post** _and_ **uploads a Reel video** to an Instagram Business/Professional profile every hour. Vibe-coded solution in under a day, not too pretty, but working nicely.

- Fact text is generated per-run from a rotating list of **niches**
- Image poster is generated by OpenAI `gpt-image-1` with the text overlaid
- Reel is a simple 1080x1920 MP4 with a slow panning and **voiceover** of the fact using OpenAI TTS
- Publishes **Photo Post** _and_ **Reel** via the Instagram Graph API, using **S3** as middle-man

# Requirements

1. Facebook profile, and a separate appropriate Facebook page
2. Instagram profile with Business/Professional mode enabled
3. Meta App with appropriate secrets and configs to be used
4. OpenAI API keys, with relevant completed "Verify Organization" verification
5. AWS account with S3 setup and access
