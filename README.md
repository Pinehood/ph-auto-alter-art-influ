# Introduction

Welcome to **Pinehood's Automatic Alternative Artificial Influencer (@alter_art_influ)**

Node.js and TypeScript application that runs a cron job, which **creates an Photo Post** _and/or_ **uploads a Reel video** to an Instagram Business/Professional profile periodicaly, depending on the Cron expression that is chosen. Vibe-coded solution in under a day and manually updated few times, it's not too pretty, but it's working nicely.

- Fact text is generated per-run from a rotating list of **niches**
- Image poster is generated by OpenAI `gpt-image-1` with the text overlaid
- Reel is a simple 1080x1920 MP4 with a slow panning and **voiceover** of the fact using OpenAI TTS
- Publishes **Photo Post** _and/or_ **Video Reel** via the Instagram Graph API, using **S3** as middle-man
- You can also use `combinator` to combine multiple Reels into a single longer Reel, or even a **Carousel** Post
