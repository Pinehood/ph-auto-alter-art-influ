# Introduction

Welcome to **Pinehood's Automatic Alternative Artificial Influencer (@alter_art_influ)**

Node.js & TypeScript application that runs a cron job, which **creates an Photo Post** _and_ **uploads a Reel video** to an Instagram Business/Professional profile every hour.

- Fact text is generated per-run from a rotating list of **niches**
- Image poster is generated by OpenAI `gpt-image-1` with the text overlaid
- Reel is a simple 1080x1920 MP4 with a slow Ken Burns pan and **voiceover** of the generated fact text using OpenAI TTS
- Publishes **Photo Post** _and_ **Reel** via the Instagram Graph API, using **S3** as middle-man

# Requirements

1. Facebook profile, and a separate Facebook page
2. Instagram profile with Business/Professional mode enabled
3. OpenAI API keys, with relevant completed "Verify Organization" verification
4. AWS account with S3 setup and access
